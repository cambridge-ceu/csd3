```

These are wrapped up as :star::star::star: **[modules](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)** :star::star::star:.

The original list prior to mid-November 2022 is given below[^original].

## Usage

We illustrate with `pspp`. A brief description of a module is available with

```bash
module help ceuadmin/pspp
```

and the module is loaded and graphical user interface (GUI)[^gui] started with

```bash
module load ceuadmin/pspp
psppire
```

for version 2.0.1. Once the job is done, one can restore the previous environment with

```bash
module unload ceuadmin/pspp
```

Note that `module add/rm` is equivalent to `module load/unload`.

Some modules are based on compiled Java (.jar) which can be called directly but it is handy to use preset environment variables, e.g.,

```bash
module load ceuadmin/picard
java -jar ${PICARD_HOME}/picard.jar --help

```

A full list of module subcommands is available with `module help` as detailed here for
[3.2.9](https://linux.die.net/man/4/modulefile) -- cclake uses version 3.2.10 (2012-12-21) while icelake uses 4.5.2 (2020-07-30). In particular, `module whatis ceuadmin/ensembl-vep` indicates usage regarding build37/build38 setup for the `loftee` plugin used in loss of function (LoF)
annotation.

## CEU users

CEU users will be able to use `ANNOVAR`, `ensembl-vep`, `OpenMS` (ceuadmin/OpenMS/3.4.0 now available for CSD3 users), `phenoscanner` (MySQL server yet to resolve), `polyphen`,
`KentUtils`/`MAGMA`/`Pascal`/`VEGASV2`/`fgwas`/`locuszoom` linking internal projects/personal space (additional requests need to be 
made).

### R

A large collection of R packages (1,772 as of 15/7/2025, esp. with availability of major machine learning packages) is linked with the
latest R distribution, 4.5.1; there are also packages (CRAN: DescTools, Rfast, Rfast2, rcompanion, rms -- which requires stringi
herein, riskRegression -- which requires rms; Bioconductor: BiocSingular, DropletUtils, DSS, beachmat, bsseq, scater, scuttle) under
4.5.1-gcc11. Earlier versions such as sf, terra, riskRegression, rms, scater, scuttle, SKAT were removed when they appear for 4.5.1-gcc11.
For Rserve 1.8-15, openssl/3.3.0-dev appears working.

Note that with recent work on gdal/3.0.4, sf 1.0-21 has been compiled enabling raster 3.6-32, stars 0.6-8, terra 1.8-50 (not 1.8-54 but
it appears working with module gdal/3.7.0-icl), maptiles 0.10.0 / tmap 4.1. Moreover, rgdal has been replaced with sf and withdrawn
from CRAN according to information there.

It is easy to point to them, e.g.,

```bash
export HPC_WORK=/rds/user/$USER/hpc-work/
export RDS=/rds/project/jmmh2/rds-jmmh2-public_databases/software
export R_LIBS=${RDS}/R:${RDS}/R-gcc11
```

or possible to have your own installations based on these, e.g., through creation of a modified `Makefile` with altered prefix followed
by `make install -f <modified Makefile>`.

The following script tests for loading of `dplyr`:

```bash
export RDS=/rds/project/jmmh2/rds-jmmh2-public_databases/software
export PATH=${PATH}
export R_LIBS=${RDS}:${RDS}/R
Rscript -e 'suppressMessages(library(dplyr));cat("OK!\n")'
```

It appears clumsy to do these every time, so an attempt is made to have them in a module, namely

```bash
module load ceuadmin/R/latest
which R
echo $R_LIBS
Rscript -e 'suppressMessages(library(dplyr));cat("OK!\n")'
```

Inside R, one can check paths with `.libPaths()`. It is also handy to re-install the small number of packages in R-gcc11 with `install.packages(dir())` at its folder but
`BiocManager::install(c("beachmat", "BiocSingular", "DropletUtils", "scater", "scuttle"))`.

### Python

There are many sources,

1. miniconda37/. Collections for Miniconda3 which is appropriate for a variety of software including its distribution of R.
2. py2.7/. Collections for Python 2.7.
3. py38/. Collections for Python 3.8.
4. py3.11/. Collections for Python 3.11.

One can use `source` command to load/install packages, e.g., `source ${RDS}/py38/bin/activate`. A list of modules can be checked with

```bash
conda list
pip list
```

for Minicoda and Python, respectively.

## Non-CEU users

Most software are available for all CSD3 users, only limited by software with excessive size / reference data -- which ideally will be
available from `/rds/project/jmmh2/software` but now `/rds/project/jmmh2/rds-jmmh2-public_databases/software` as a trade-off. These can
largely be seen as sources which are used to build the reoository given above.

Please drop an email to <jhz22@medschl.cam.ac.uk> for access.

## Module creation

The following example shows how to set up a module,

```bash
#!/bin/bash

mkdir tmp-xz
cd tmp-xz
wget http://tukaani.org/xz/xz-5.2.2.tar.gz
tar zxvf xz-5.2.2.tar.gz
cd xz-5.2.2
mkdir -p /usr/local/Cluster-Apps/xz/5.2.2
export PREFIX=/usr/local/Cluster-Apps/xz/5.2.2
./configure --prefix=$PREFIX
make
make check
sg swinst 'make install'

cat << 'EOL' > /usr/local/Cluster-Config/modulefiles/xz/5.2.2
#%Module -*- tcl -*-
##
## modulefile
##
proc ModulesHelp { } {

  puts stderr "\tXZ Utils is free general-purpose data compression software with a high compression ratio.\n"
  puts stderr "\tInstalled under: /usr/local/Cluster-Apps/xz/5.2.2
     Hompage:http://tukaani.org/xz/"

}

module-whatis "xz free general-purpose data compression"

conflict xz
set               root                  /usr/local/Cluster-Apps/xz/5.2.2
prepend-path      PATH                  $root/bin
prepend-path      MANPATH               $root/man
prepend-path      LD_LIBRARY_PATH       $root/lib
prepend-path      LIBRARY_PATH          $root/lib
prepend-path      FPATH                 $root/include
prepend-path      CPATH                 $root/include
prepend-path      INCLUDE               $root/include
setenv            XZ_HOME               $root
EOL
```

The module is made visible through environment variable MODULEPATH. Note that there will be permission issue for a user, however, to make changes to `/usr/local/Cluster-Apps`.

The module files are defined at **/usr/local/Cluster-Config/modulefiles/ceuadmin**. Most software stay with gcc/6 due to many dependencies of built modules; when required it can be enabled with `module load gcc/6`; however packages could also require `libgfortran.so.5` as in `gcc/9` -- as a compromise one can amend `.bashrc` to include lines such as `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/software/master/gcc/9/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
