# R/gsl

When there is message,

```
configure: error: Need GSL version >= 1.16
ERROR: configuration failed for package ‘gsl’
* removing ‘/rds/user/jhz22/hpc-work/R/gsl’
* restoring previous ‘/rds/user/jhz22/hpc-work/R/gsl’

The downloaded source packages are in
        ‘/tmp/Rtmp5Qygwr/downloaded_packages’
Warning message:
In install.packages("gsl") :
  installation of package ‘gsl’ had non-zero exit status
```

Our first attempt is to load modules as for `R/gnn`

```bash
module avail gsl
module load gsl/2.4
```

Unfortunately, the same error message remains.

Our second attempt is to install from source

```bash
Rscript -e download.packages("gsl",".")'
# unpack the downloaded version
tar xvfz gsl_2.1-7.tar.gz
cd gsl
mv configure configure.sav
gsl-config --cflags
gsl-lib
```
