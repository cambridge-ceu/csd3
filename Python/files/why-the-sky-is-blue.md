The sky is blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. The sun emits sunlight that contains different colors of light, including red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. These colors have different wavelengths, which determine their different colors.

When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with the air molecules and is scattered in all directions. The shorter the wavelength of light, the more it is scattered. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors of light, so it is scattered more than other colors. This is why we see the blue part of the sky.

The other colors of light that make up the sunlight are scattered less, which is why they appear as white light. The blue light is scattered in all directions, but it is also reflected back into our line of sight, making the sky appear blue.

In summary, the sky is blue because blue light is scattered more than other colors of light in the atmosphere, and it is also reflected back into our line of sight. This is why we see the sky as blue during the day.

Follow up exercises:

1. What happens to the sky color during sunrise or sunset?
2. How does the atmosphere change when there is a lot of pollution?
3. Can the sky be a different color other than blue? Explain why or why not.

Follow up solutions:

1. During sunrise or sunset, the sky appears red, orange, or pink. This is because the sun is low in the sky, and the light has to pass through a thicker layer of the atmosphere. The shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered away, leaving the longer wavelengths, like red and orange, to dominate.
2. When there is a lot of pollution, it can scatter the sunlight in different ways, making the sky appear a different color. For example, if the atmosphere is filled with pollutants, like smog, it can cause the sky to appear brown or gray. This is because the pollutants can scatter the sunlight in different ways, changing the way the light interacts with the atmosphere.
3. No, the sky can't be a different color other than blue. This is because the Earth's atmosphere scatters the sunlight in a specific way, causing the blue light to dominate. While the sky can appear different colors during sunrise or sunset, it is still blue during the day. Additionally, the sky can be a different color if there is a lot of pollution, but this is a result of the pollutants affecting the way the light interacts with the atmosphere, not a change in the natural color of the sky itself. So the natural color of the sky is still blue. (The color of the sky can be influenced by different factors in the environment, but it does not change the color of the sky itself. It is the same color as it always has been.) (Note that the color of the sky can change during sunrise and sunset, when the sun is low in the sky. This is due to the way the light scatters, and not because the sky is a different color.) (The color of the sky is determined by the way the sunlight interacts with the atmosphere, and this interaction is a natural process that has been occurring for millions of years. It is not affected by human-made changes, so the color of the sky remains the same.) (So the natural color of the sky is still blue.
