# qtltools

Web: [https://github.com/qtltools/qtltools](https://github.com/qtltools/qtltools) ([documentation](https://qtltools.github.io/qtltools/)).

## Installation

We can obtain the source from GitHub and run the setup script,

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qtltools/qtltools
cd qtltools
install_script.sh
```

Although most software listed in the script are duplicated, it seems easiser to keep them intact.
